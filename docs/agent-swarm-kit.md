# Agent Swarm Kit

## Overview

The agent-swarm-kit is a TypeScript framework designed for creating and managing swarms of intelligent agents that can collaborate, communicate, and coordinate with each other. At its core are services for managing various components: agents (via AgentConnectionService), swarms (via SwarmConnectionService), sessions (via SessionConnectionService), history tracking (via HistoryConnectionService), and storage (via StorageConnectionService).

The system follows a validation-schema pattern where each component (tools, agents, swarms, storage, embeddings, and completions) has both a validation service for runtime checks and a schema service for type definitions. Client implementations (ClientAgent, ClientSwarm, ClientSession, ClientHistory, and ClientStorage) provide concrete implementations of these services' interfaces.

The framework designed with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to create complex agent interactions while maintaining control through validation, schema enforcement, and proper connection management. Public services act as fa√ßades, providing simplified interfaces for external consumers, while connection services handle the internal complexity of maintaining state, coordinating components, and enforcing business rules.
