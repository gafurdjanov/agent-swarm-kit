# Agent Swarm Kit

## Overview

The agent-swarm-kit is a TypeScript framework designed for creating and managing swarms of intelligent agents that can collaborate, communicate, and coordinate with each other. At its core are services for managing various components: agents (via AgentConnectionService), swarms (via SwarmConnectionService), sessions (via SessionConnectionService), history tracking (via HistoryConnectionService), and storage (via StorageConnectionService).

The system follows a validation-schema pattern where each component (tools, agents, swarms, storage, embeddings, and completions) has both a validation service for runtime checks and a schema service for type definitions. Client implementations (ClientAgent, ClientSwarm, ClientSession, ClientHistory, and ClientStorage) provide concrete implementations of these services' interfaces.

The framework designed with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to create complex agent interactions while maintaining control through validation, schema enforcement, and proper connection management. Public services act as fa√ßades, providing simplified interfaces for external consumers, while connection services handle the internal complexity of maintaining state, coordinating components, and enforcing business rules.

## ToolValidationService

The `ToolValidationService` is a service designed for validating tools within an agent-swarm system. It provides a way to add new tools and validate their existence. The service utilizes a loggerService for logging purposes and maintains an internal tool map (_toolMap) for efficient storage and retrieval of tools.

To add a new tool to the validation service, you can use the `addTool` function. This function takes two parameters: `toolName`, which is the name of the tool, and `toolSchema`, which is an object representing the schema of the tool.

To validate if a specific tool exists in the validation service, you can use the `validate` function. This function takes two parameters: `toolName`, which is the name of the tool to be validated, and `source`, which represents the source of the tool.

By using these functions, you can effectively manage and validate tools within your agent-swarm system.

## ToolSchemaService
