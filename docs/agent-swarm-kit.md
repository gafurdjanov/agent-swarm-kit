# agent-swarm-kit api reference

**Overall Architecture:**

This system built around a distributed, asynchronous architecture. Agents communicate via a message queue, and their interactions are orchestrated through a series of tools and processes. The core concept is to allow agents to perform tasks independently while still being part of a larger, coordinated system.

**Core Concepts & Relationships**

* **Swarm Orchestration:** The entire framework is built around orchestrating agents to perform tasks.
* **Agent as the Central Unit:** The `IAgent` is the fundamental building block – the individual agent that executes tasks.
* **Communication (Bus):** The `IAgentParams` interface highlights the importance of the `bus` (a messaging system) for agents to communicate and coordinate.
* **History Management:** The `IAgent` and `IAgentParams` emphasize the agent's ability to operate without relying on conversation history (using the `run` method).
* **Tool Execution:** The `IAgent`’s `call` and `execute` methods are central to running tools within the agent.
* **Schema & Configuration:** The `IAgentSchema` defines the configuration for each agent, including its tools, prompt, and completion mechanism.

**Interface Breakdown & Key Responsibilities**

Here’s a summary of each interface and its role:

* **`IAgent`:** The core runtime agent.  Handles independent execution, tool calls, message commitment, and lifecycle management.
* **`IAgentParams`:**  Provides the agent with the necessary parameters for operation, including its ID, logging, communication channel, and history management.
* **`IAgentSchema`:** Defines the configuration settings for an agent (tools, prompt, completion mechanism).
* **`IAgentSchemaCallbacks`:**  Provides callbacks for managing different stages of an agent’s lifecycle (init, run, output, etc.).
* **`IAgentConnectionService`:** A type definition for an `AgentConnectionService` – a service that manages connections between the agents.

**Workflow Implications**

Based on these interfaces, here’s a workflow:

1. **Agent Configuration:** An `IAgentSchema` is created to define the agent’s settings.
2. **Agent Instantiation:** An `IAgent` instance is created based on the schema.
3. **Agent Execution:** The `IAgent`’s `execute` method is called to initiate independent operation.
4. **Tool Calls:**  The `IAgent` uses `call` to execute tools.
5. **Message Handling:** The `IAgent` uses `commitToolOutput`, `commitSystemMessage`, and `commitUserMessage` to manage messages.
6. **Communication:** The `IAgent` uses the `bus` (via `IAgentParams`) to communicate with other agents.

**Key Concepts & Implications:**

* **State Management:** Agents maintain their own state (conversation history, tool outputs, etc.).
* **Decoupling:** The interfaces are designed to decouple different components of the system. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** The use of callbacks suggests an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls.
* **State Management:** The interfaces highlight the importance of managing the agent's state, including conversation history, tool output, and system messages.
* **Tool Integration:** The `tools` property in `IAgentParams` indicates a system designed to integrate with external tools.
* **Asynchronous Communication:** Agents communicate asynchronously via a bus, allowing them to operate independently.
* **Flexibility:** The system is designed to be flexible, a

**Potential Use Cases:**

This architecture could be used for a wide range of applications, including:

* **Chatbots:**  Agents could be used to power conversational AI systems.
* **Content Generation:** Agents could be used to generate text, images, or other content.
* **Data Analysis:** Agents could be used to analyze data and generate insights.

Key features include the ability to create or retrieve chat instances for clients using the `getChatInstance` method.  You can initiate a new chat session for a client with the `beginChat` method, passing in the client ID and swarm name.  Sending messages to clients is handled by the `sendMessage` method, also requiring the client ID and swarm name.

The class also supports listening for disposal events using the `listenDispose` method, allowing you to react to when a client's chat instance is no longer needed.  Finally, you can manage the chat instance constructor and callbacks through the `useChatAdapter` and `useChatCallbacks` methods, respectively.  The `dispose` method provides a way to cleanly remove a chat instance when it's finished.

## Class BusService

The BusService is the central component for managing event communication within the swarm system. It implements the IBus interface, providing methods to subscribe to and emit events, ensuring a robust and flexible event-driven architecture. The service utilizes memoized Subject instances for optimized performance, reducing overhead by reusing Subjects for client-specific event handling.

Key functionalities include subscribing to events for specific clients and event sources, emitting events to relevant subscribers, and managing session validation through the SessionValidationService to maintain data integrity. Wildcard subscriptions (using clientId="*") enable broad event distribution, while execution-specific event aliases facilitate targeted event handling within ClientAgent and PerfService.

The BusService integrates seamlessly with other system components. It receives execution events from ClientAgent (e.g., during EXECUTE_FN), tracks execution metrics via PerfService, and logs event activity through the LoggerService, aligning with the system’s logging patterns. The service’s lifecycle management is handled through the `dispose` method, ensuring proper resource cleanup for each client.  The `once` subscription method provides a mechanism for handling single-event scenarios, complementing the standard subscribe functionality.

## Class AgentConnectionService

Okay, this is a fantastic and incredibly detailed breakdown of the `ClientAgent` class. You've done a phenomenal job of outlining its functionality, its interactions with other components, and the rationale behind its design choices. Here's a breakdown of my observations and some potential areas for further consideration, categorized for clarity:

**1. Core Functionality & Design Rationale:**

* **Layered Abstraction:** The design clearly aims for a layered abstraction.  The `ClientAgent` sits between the higher-level API calls (like `execute`, `run`, `waitForOutput`) and the underlying OpenAI API or other LLM implementations. This is crucial for flexibility and maintainability.
* **Memoization:** The use of `functools.lru_cache` (or a similar caching mechanism) is a brilliant optimization. It dramatically reduces the overhead of repeatedly creating and initializing `ClientAgent` instances, especially in scenarios where the same agent is used multiple times.
* **Session-Awareness:** The `MethodContextService` integration is key. It allows the `ClientAgent` to maintain state and context across multiple interactions, mimicking the behavior of a session.
* **History Management:** The extensive `commit...` methods (tool output, system messages, assistant messages, user messages, agent changes, flush) are central to the design, reflecting the importance of maintaining a conversation history for context and potential future analysis.
* **Tool Execution Control:** The `commitStopTools` and `commitFlush` methods highlight the ability to control the flow of tool execution, which is essential for complex workflows.

**2. Key Observations & Potential Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The documentation doesn't explicitly mention error handling. This is a critical area. How does the `ClientAgent` handle API errors, network issues, or invalid input?  Robust error handling and retry mechanisms would significantly improve the reliability of the component.
* **Concurrency:**  The memoization suggests that the `ClientAgent` is designed to be used concurrently.  However, you need to consider thread safety.  If multiple threads are accessing the same `ClientAgent` instance, you'll need appropriate locking or synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
* **Logging:**  While logging is present in the `dispose` method, consider adding logging to other methods as well, especially during initialization, error handling, and state transitions.  Detailed logging will be invaluable for debugging and monitoring.
* **Configuration:**  How are things like the API key, model name, and other settings configured?  Is there a centralized configuration mechanism, or are they hardcoded?
* **Testing:**  This class is incredibly complex.  Thorough unit and integration tests are absolutely essential to ensure its correctness and stability.

**3. Specific Method Deep Dive (Suggestions):**

* **`commitAgentChange()`:**  This is particularly interesting.  It suggests a mechanism for altering the agent's state *during* execution.  It would be beneficial to clarify *how* this change is represented and applied.  Is it a flag, a variable, or something else?
* **`commitFlush()`:**  The purpose of a "flush" is to clear the history.  It's important to understand the implications of this action – does it affect the agent's current state, or is it purely a cleanup operation?

**4. Overall Assessment:**

You've created a remarkably well-designed and sophisticated component. The focus on abstraction, caching, and session management demonstrates a strong understanding of the challenges involved in building a robust and scalable LLM client.

**To help me further refine my feedback, could you tell me:**

*   What is the primary use case for this `ClientAgent`? (e.g., a chatbot, a data analysis tool, a creative writing assistant?)
*   What is the underlying LLM implementation that the `ClientAgent` interacts with? (e.g., OpenAI's API, a locally hosted model, etc.)
*   Are there any specific areas where you're particularly interested in getting feedback? (e.g., error handling, concurrency, testing?)

## Class AdapterUtils

The AdapterUtils class offers a flexible way to connect to different AI completion services. It provides utility functions, each designed to interact with a specific provider.

# agent-swarm-kit interfaces

## Interface IToolCall

The IToolCall interface represents a specific request made by an AI agent within the swarm system. It’s essentially a single execution of a tool, triggered by the model’s output.  This interface is used by agents like the ClientAgent to connect the model’s instructions to actual actions.

Each IToolCall has a unique identifier, “id,” which is generated to track the tool execution and link it back to the original request. This ID, such as “tool-xyz123,” is crucial for correlating the tool’s output with its origin.

The type of tool being called is always a “function,” as defined by the swarm’s architecture.  This specifies that the tool being invoked is a callable function.

The core of the IToolCall is the “function” property, which contains the details needed to execute the tool. This includes the tool’s name and any arguments required for the function call. Agents use this information to find the appropriate function and execute it, often triggering callbacks to handle the tool’s output and update the system’s state.

## Interface ITool

The ITool interface is a core component of the swarm system, acting as a blueprint for each available tool. It defines everything the agents need to know about a specific function – essentially, how to call it. 

Each ITool specifies a `type`, currently always "function," which indicates the tool's category. This aligns with the `type` property in the `IToolCall` object.

Crucially, it includes a `function` property that contains detailed information about the tool. This includes the tool’s `name` and `description`, along with a schema outlining the expected `parameters`. This parameter schema is used by the model, specifically within the `ClientAgent`, to generate the correct `IToolCall` requests when interacting with the tool. The parameter schema is then matched against the `function` property during execution, ensuring the tool is invoked with the right inputs.

## Interface ISwarmSessionCallbacks

The `ISwarmSessionCallbacks` interface defines a set of callbacks that allow you to react to various events happening within a swarm session. These callbacks provide hooks for key moments like when a client connects, when a command is executed, or when a message is emitted.

Specifically, you can use the `onConnect` callback to perform actions upon a client joining the swarm, such as logging the connection or running initial setup. The `onExecute` callback is triggered whenever a command is run, and the `onRun` callback handles stateless completion runs.  Furthermore, the `onEmit` callback responds to messages sent from the swarm, and the `onInit` and `onDispose` callbacks manage the session’s initialization and disconnection events, respectively. These callbacks offer granular control over how your application interacts with and responds to the swarm’s activity.

## Interface ISwarmCallbacks

The ISwarmCallbacks interface provides a set of functions to manage and monitor the lifecycle of an AI agent swarm. It builds upon standard session callbacks and adds specific functionality related to individual agents.

The primary function, `onAgentChanged`, is triggered whenever the currently active agent within the swarm shifts. This callback is particularly useful for tracking agent movement, updating state based on agent location, or reacting to changes in the swarm’s operational focus.  It receives the agent’s unique identifier (`clientId`), its assigned name (`agentName`), and the name of the swarm it belongs to (`swarmName`).


## Interface ISwarm

The ISwarm interface provides a central control point for managing a group of AI agents. It offers a suite of methods to handle the agents’ movement and activity. Primarily, the `navigationPop` method allows you to remove and retrieve the most recent agent from the swarm’s navigation stack, or to fall back to a default agent if needed.  You can also cancel any ongoing output operations using `cancelOutput`, which guarantees an empty string is returned when calling `waitForOutput`. This method waits for and returns the output generated by the swarm’s currently active agent.  Furthermore, the interface provides ways to identify the active agent through `getAgentName` and retrieve its instance with `getAgent`. Finally, `setAgentRef` is used to register or update agent references within the swarm’s internal mapping, and `setAgentName` allows you to designate a specific agent as the active one, triggering necessary navigation updates.

## Interface IStorageSchema

The `IStorageSchema` interface defines the configuration for how a storage instance operates within the AI agent swarm. It controls aspects like whether data is saved persistently, how the storage is accessed, and how it’s indexed for searching.

Key settings include a `persist` flag to enable or disable saving data to a hard drive, a `storageName` to uniquely identify the storage within the swarm, and an `embedding` to specify the indexing mechanism.

You can customize storage behavior with optional functions like `getData` and `setData`, which allow you to override the default data retrieval and persistence methods.  A `callbacks` section provides a way to react to storage events, and a `getDefaultData` function is used during persistence to provide initial data. Finally, the `createIndex` function generates a unique index for each stored item, facilitating efficient searching.

## Interface IStorageCallbacks

The `IStorageCallbacks` interface defines a set of callbacks that allow you to react to various events related to the storage system. These callbacks provide hooks for handling updates to the stored data – triggered whenever items are added, removed, or modified. You can also use them to monitor search operations as they occur.

Specifically, the `onUpdate` callback is invoked each time the storage data changes, giving you the opportunity to log these updates or synchronize your application’s state with the storage. The `onSearch` callback is triggered during a search, and the `onInit` callback is called when the storage is first initialized. Finally, the `onDispose` callback is executed when the storage is being shut down, allowing for cleanup tasks.

## Interface IStorage

The IStorage interface provides a core API for managing data within the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. It offers a set of methods to interact with the underlying storage, allowing you to retrieve, modify, and delete items.

Specifically, the `take` method enables similarity-based retrieval of items, using embeddings to find relevant data based on a search query and a specified total count. The `upsert` method handles both inserting new items and updating existing ones, ensuring the index is kept synchronized.  You can also use `remove` to delete items by their unique ID, and `get` to retrieve a single item based on its ID.

Furthermore, the `list` method provides a way to list all items in the storage, with the option to filter the results using a provided predicate function. Finally, the `clear` method allows you to completely reset the storage to an empty state, persisting any changes that have been made.

## Interface IStateSchema

The `IStateSchema` interface is central to managing the state of individual agents within the swarm. It defines how each state is configured and how it behaves.

Key aspects of the `IStateSchema` include:

*   **`persist`**: This boolean flag controls whether the state’s values are saved to persistent storage, like a hard drive, ensuring data isn’t lost when an agent restarts.
*   **`docDescription`**:  A descriptive string that provides context and documentation for the state, aiding in understanding its purpose and usage.
*   **`shared`**:  When set to `true`, this flag indicates that the state can be accessed and modified by multiple agents within the swarm.
*   **`stateName`**:  This unique identifier ensures that each state within the swarm is clearly distinguished.
*   **`getDefaultState`**:  A function that either retrieves a pre-defined default state value or calculates it dynamically, based on the agent’s ID and the state’s name.
*   **`getState`**:  This function provides a way to retrieve the current state value. It can optionally use a provided default state if the current state isn’t available.
*   **`setState`**:  This function allows you to set or update the state’s value, overriding the default behavior if a custom setting is provided.
*   **`middlewares`**: An optional array of middleware functions that can be applied to the state during its lifecycle, allowing for pre-processing or post-processing of state data.
*   **`callbacks`**:  A partial set of lifecycle callbacks that can be used to trigger actions or events at specific points in the state’s lifecycle, offering a flexible way to customize state events.

## Interface IStateParams

The `IStateParams` interface defines the runtime settings needed for managing state within the AI agent swarm. It builds upon a core state schema, adding details specific to each individual client.

## Interface IOutgoingMessage

The IOutgoingMessage interface defines how messages are sent out from the swarm system. It represents a message directed to a client, often an agent’s response or output. 

This interface encapsulates three key pieces of information: the `clientId`, which uniquely identifies the client receiving the message – matching the `clientId` specified in the message parameters; the `data`, which is the actual content of the message, typically a string representing the agent’s response or processed result; and the `agentName`, which identifies the originating agent sending the message.  This allows the system to track the source of each outgoing message.


## Interface IModelMessage

This interface, IModelMessage, is the fundamental building block for communication within the swarm system. It represents a single message exchanged between any part of the system – agents, tools, users, or the system itself. These messages are crucial for tracking the history of interactions, generating responses from the model, and broadcasting events throughout the swarm.

The core of an IModelMessage is its `content`, which holds the actual data being communicated, like user input, model responses, or tool outputs.  The `role` property specifies the origin of the message, with common roles including "assistant" (generated by the model), "system" (for system-level notifications), "tool" (for tool outputs), and "user" (for user-initiated messages).

Each message is associated with a specific `agentName`, linking it to the agent responsible for its creation or transmission.  Additionally, the `mode` property indicates the context of the message, typically "user" for stateless runs or "tool" for tool-related activities.

When a model requests a tool execution, an IModelMessage can contain an array of `tool_calls` – objects detailing the specific tool requests and their associated parameters.  A unique `tool_call_id` is also provided to link the message’s output back to its corresponding tool call, ensuring a clear chain of execution.  This structured approach allows for comprehensive tracking and management of all interactions within the dynamic swarm environment.

## Interface ILoggerAdapter

The `ILoggerAdapter` interface is a core component of the AI agent swarm orchestration framework, providing a standardized way to manage logging for individual clients. It’s implemented by `LoggerUtils` to tailor logging operations to the specific needs of each client.

This interface defines methods for logging messages at different severity levels – `log`, `debug`, and `info`.  Each method takes the client ID and a topic as input, and then logs a message to the client’s dedicated logger instance.  Crucially, before logging, the system performs session validation and initialization, guaranteeing that the logging setup is ready.

The `dispose` method is used to cleanly remove the logger instance for a client from the system’s cache, ensuring proper resource management and preventing potential issues when a client is no longer active. Like the other logging methods, it performs session validation and initialization prior to releasing the logger.

## Interface ILogger

The ILogger interface is the core logging system for the entire swarm orchestration framework. It allows components – including agents, sessions, states, storage, and various other systems – to record messages at different levels of importance. 

You can use the `log` method to record general events and state changes, like agent executions or session connections. The `debug` method is designed for detailed diagnostic information, such as tracking intermediate steps during tool calls or embedding creation.

Finally, the `iterate` method enables you to asynchronously loop through all messages in the history for a given client and agent, providing a flexible way to process the entire message log.


## Interface IHistory

The IHistory interface manages the conversation history within the AI agent swarm. It allows you to track and manipulate the sequence of messages exchanged with the model.

Key features include:

*   **push:**  Adds a new model message to the end of the history, updating the history store asynchronously.
*   **pop:** Removes and returns the most recently added model message from the history.
*   **toArrayForAgent:** Converts the history into an array of messages, specifically formatted for a particular agent. This function filters or adapts messages based on a given prompt and any associated system prompts.
*   **toArrayForRaw:** Retrieves the entire history as a single array of raw model messages, without any agent-specific filtering or formatting.

## Interface IGlobalConfig

Okay, this is a comprehensive list of configuration constants and default functions used within the `ClientAgent` system. Let's break down the key aspects and their implications:

**1. Core Configuration Constants:**

*   **`CC_SKIP_POSIX_RENAME`**:  Controls whether the system uses standard POSIX-style file renaming.  Disabling this might be necessary if the persistence layer uses a different file system or renaming mechanism.
*   **`CC_PERSIST_MEMORY_STORAGE`**:  Determines if memory storage is enabled.  This refers to a separate storage mechanism within the system, potentially for caching or temporary data.
*   **`CC_PROCES_UUID`**:  A unique identifier for the current process.  This is crucial for tracking and debugging.
*   **`CC_BANHAMMER_PLACEHOLDER`**:  A placeholder response used when a client attempts to engage in banned topics or actions.
*   **`CC_DEFAULT_STATE_SET`, `CC_DEFAULT_STATE_GET`, `CC_DEFAULT_STORAGE_GET`, `CC_DEFAULT_STORAGE_SET`**: These constants define default behavior for state management and storage operations.  They provide a fallback mechanism if custom configuration isn't provided.

**2.  Exception Handling & Recovery:**

*   **`CC_TOOL_CALL_EXCEPTION_CUSTOM_FUNCTION`**: This is a critical function for handling exceptions that occur during tool calls.  The `setConfig` option allows you to customize the recovery logic.  The default `null` return indicates a simple failure.

**3.  Persistence & Storage:**

*   The constants related to storage (`CC_PERSIST_MEMORY_STORAGE`, `CC_DEFAULT_STORAGE_GET`, `CC_DEFAULT_STORAGE_SET`) govern how data is persisted and retrieved.  This involves a storage layer (potentially in-memory or on disk).

**4.  Policy & Enforcement:**

*   **`CC_BANHAMMER_PLACEHOLDER`**:  Used to indicate a banned topic or action.
*   **`CC_AUTOBAN_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT`**:  Determines whether automatic banning is enabled by default.

**5.  Other Important Constants:**

*   **`CC_SKIP_POSIX_RENAME`**:  File system operations.

**Overall Implications & Use Cases:**

*   **Customization:** The key takeaway is that many of these constants have default values, but they can be overridden using `setConfig`. This allows you to tailor the system's behavior to your specific needs.
*   **Error Handling:** The `CC_TOOL_CALL_EXCEPTION_CUSTOM_FUNCTION` is a vital component for robust error handling, especially when dealing with external tool calls.
*   **Persistence Layer:** Understanding the storage constants is essential for managing data persistence.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** The banhammer placeholder and auto-ban settings are central to policy control.

## Interface IExecutionContext

The `IExecutionContext` interface provides a standardized way to manage information about each running execution within the swarm system. It’s a central component used by services like ClientAgent, PerfService, and BusService to track and manage individual executions.

Key properties within the `IExecutionContext` include:

*   **clientId:** A unique string that identifies the client session. This is consistently used by ClientAgent and PerfService for tracking.
*   **executionId:** A unique string that represents the specific instance of the execution. It’s utilized in PerfService, particularly during the `startExecution` operation, and in BusService for actions like `commitExecutionBegin`.
*   **processId:** A unique string derived from `GLOBAL_CONFIG.CC_PROCESSED_UUID`. This `processId` is then used within PerfService’s `IPerformanceRecord` to further detail the execution’s context.

## Interface IEntity

The `IEntity` interface serves as the foundational building block for all data that needs to be stored and retrieved persistently within the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. It defines a standard set of properties that any entity, such as an agent or a task, will possess. 

Key aspects of the `IEntity` interface include:

*   **Unique Identifier:** Every entity must have a unique identifier to distinguish it from others.
*   **Metadata:**  It includes common metadata fields like creation timestamp, last updated timestamp, and potentially a status flag.
*   **Base for Extension:** This interface is designed to be extended with specific properties relevant to each type of entity within the swarm. 

Essentially, `IEntity` provides a consistent structure for managing and interacting with the core data elements of the system.

## Interface IEmbeddingSchema

The `IEmbeddingSchema` interface defines how the swarm manages and utilizes embedding mechanisms. It’s responsible for configuring the creation and comparison of embeddings.

Key aspects of this schema include:

*   **embeddingName:** A unique identifier for the embedding mechanism being used within the swarm.
*   **callbacks:** An optional set of callbacks that can be used to customize events related to embedding creation and comparison. This allows for flexible integration and monitoring.

The schema provides methods for:

*   **createEmbedding:** This method generates an embedding from a given text string. It’s the core function for creating the numerical representation of the text.
*   **calculateSimilarity:** This method computes the similarity between two embeddings, typically using a metric like cosine similarity. It’s essential for tasks like searching and ranking based on semantic similarity.

## Interface IEmbeddingCallbacks

The `IEmbeddingCallbacks` interface offers a way to react to key events during the lifecycle of your AI agent embeddings. It provides two primary callback functions designed for flexibility and insight.

The `onCreate` callback is invoked immediately after a new embedding is generated. You can use this to log the embedding’s creation, perform any necessary post-processing steps, or track embedding generation metrics.

Additionally, the `onCompare` callback is triggered whenever two embeddings are compared for similarity. This allows you to capture similarity scores, log comparison results, or implement custom analysis based on the similarity data.  Both callbacks receive relevant information like the text strings being compared, the similarity score, and client and embedding identifiers for tracking purposes.

## Interface ICustomEvent

The ICustomEvent interface provides a way to send custom data within the swarm system. It builds upon the broader IBaseEvent interface, offering a flexible approach to event handling. Unlike the standard IBusEvent, which has a fixed structure, ICustomEvent allows you to include any type of data in its `payload`. This is useful for creating event scenarios that don’t fit the predefined format of IBusEvent, such as sending a specific status and data object like `{ status: "complete", data: 42 }`. Essentially, it’s designed for events with unique, non-standard information.


## Interface IConfig

The `IConfig` class manages the configuration settings for UML diagram generation. Specifically, it includes a `withSubtree` property. This boolean flag, when set to `true`, instructs the system to generate UML diagrams that include nested or sub-diagrams, providing a more detailed representation of the system’s architecture.


## Interface ICompletionSchema

The `ICompletionSchema` interface defines the configuration for a completion mechanism used within the AI agent swarm. It specifies how the swarm generates responses to prompts.

Key aspects of this schema include:

*   **completionName:** A unique identifier for the completion mechanism itself, ensuring distinct behavior within the swarm.
*   **callbacks:** An optional set of callbacks that can be used to customize the actions taken after a completion is generated. This allows for flexible post-processing of the response.
*   **getCompletion:** This method is responsible for retrieving a completion. It takes arguments and generates a model response, utilizing the provided context and available tools.

## Interface ICompletionCallbacks

The `ICompletionCallbacks` interface defines how you can respond to successful completion events within the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. It offers a mechanism to execute custom actions after a completion has been generated.

Specifically, the `onComplete` callback is triggered when a completion is successfully produced. 

This callback accepts two arguments:

*   `args`: An object containing contextual information about the completion event.
*   `output`: The generated completion message itself, represented as an `IModelMessage`.

You can use this callback to perform tasks like logging the completion, processing the output, or initiating any necessary side effects based on the generated text.

## Interface ICompletionArgs

The `ICompletionArgs` interface defines the structure for requesting a completion from a language model. It bundles together all the necessary information to generate a response, including the context and specific inputs.

Key elements within this interface are:

*   **`clientId`**: A unique identifier assigned to the client making the request.
*   **`agentName`**: The name of the agent responsible for handling the completion.
*   **`mode`**:  Specifies the origin of the last message, differentiating between user input and tool outputs.
*   **`messages`**: An array of messages that form the conversation history and provide the model with the necessary context.
*   **`tools`**: An optional list of tools that the agent can utilize during the completion process, allowing for actions like tool calls.

## Interface ICompletion

The `ICompletion` interface defines the core functionality for generating responses from an AI model. It acts as a central point for any system needing to produce text-based outputs. This interface extends a broader completion schema, offering a fully-fledged API designed to handle the entire process of creating model responses. It provides a standardized way to interact with and control the generation of text, ensuring consistency across different components of the orchestration framework.

## Interface IClientPerfomanceRecord

This `IClientPerformanceRecord` interface provides detailed performance data for individual clients within a process. It’s designed to be used for analyzing client-level execution metrics, memory usage, and state information. This record is embedded within the broader `IPerformanceRecord` structure, for logging or monitoring purposes, such as in ClientAgent workflows.

Here’s a breakdown of the key properties:

*   **`clientId`**: A unique string identifier for the client, mirroring the `clientId` used in runtime parameters (e.g., `this.params.clientId`). This links the performance data directly to a specific session or agent instance, like "client-456".

*   **`sessionMemory`**: A key-value record (`Record<string, unknown>`) storing temporary data used during the client’s operation. This is similar to the `IState`’s state management capabilities within the ClientAgent. An example would be `{ "cacheKey": "value" }`.

*   **`sessionState`**: Another key-value record (`Record<string, unknown>`) representing persistent state data for the client, analogous to `IState`’s role in tracking agent state.  An example: `{ "step": 3, "active": true }`.

*   **`executionCount`**: A numerical value representing the total number of times the client’s execution was run. This contributes to the overall `executionCount` of the process.  For instance, a client that executed 10 commands would have an `executionCount` of 10.

*   **`executionInputTotal`**: The cumulative total input size processed during all executions, measured in a numeric unit (e.g., bytes). This reflects the total amount of data received by the client.  Example: 1024 for 1KB of total input.

*   **`executionOutputTotal`**: The cumulative total output size generated during all executions, also measured in a numeric unit. This represents the total amount of data produced by the client. Example: 2048 for 2KB of total output.

*   **`executionInputAverage`**: The average input size per execution, calculated by dividing `executionInputTotal` by `executionCount`. This provides a normalized measure of input data volume. Example: 102.4 for an average of 102.4 bytes per execution.

*   **`executionOutputAverage`**: The average output size per execution, calculated similarly to `executionInputAverage`. Example: 204.8 for an average of 204.8 bytes per execution.

*   **`executionTimeTotal`**: The total execution time for the client, formatted as a string (e.g., "300ms" or "1.5s"). This represents the cumulative duration of all executions and contributes to the overall response time.

*   **`executionTimeAverage`**: The average execution time per execution, formatted as a string (e.g., "30ms" per execution). This provides a normalized measure of latency.

## Interface IChatInstanceCallbacks

The `IChatInstanceCallbacks` interface provides a set of callback functions to manage the lifecycle and interactions of an AI agent instance within a swarm. These callbacks are triggered at specific moments during the instance's operation.

When the instance is initialized, the `onInit` callback is invoked, passing the client ID, swarm name, and the instance itself.

During chat activity, the `onCheckActivity` callback is used to monitor the status of the instance, indicating whether it's currently active and providing information about its last activity.

The `onBeginChat` callback is called when a new chat session starts.

Finally, the `onSendMessage` callback is triggered whenever a message is sent through the instance.

The `onDispose` callback is invoked when the instance is being shut down, allowing for cleanup operations.

## Interface IChatInstance

The `IChatInstance` represents a single chat session within the AI agent swarm orchestration framework. It provides methods for initiating and managing that session.

You can start a new chat session using the `beginChat` method, which returns a promise when the session is established.

The `checkLastActivity` method allows you to monitor if the chat has been used recently, taking a timestamp as input to define the timeout period.

To send messages to the chat, use the `sendMessage` method, passing the message content as a string. This method also returns a promise.

Finally, the `dispose` method allows you to cleanly shut down the chat instance, and the `listenDispose` method enables you to receive notifications when the instance is being disposed of, receiving the client ID of the disposed instance.


## Interface IChatControl

The `IChatControl` module provides a way to manage and configure an AI agent swarm. It offers two primary methods for customizing the swarm's behavior.  The `useChatAdapter` method allows you to specify the constructor for your chat instance, giving you control over how the chat functionality is created.  Additionally, the `useChatCallbacks` method lets you define a set of callbacks that will be triggered during various stages of the swarm’s operation, providing a flexible mechanism for reacting to events within the system. These methods work together to tailor the swarm’s interaction with the underlying chat instance.

## Interface IBusEventContext

The `IBusEventContext` interface provides supplementary information surrounding an event within the swarm system. It’s designed to enrich the standard event data, offering details about the components involved. Primarily, it includes the `agentName`, which is consistently populated in ClientAgent events – for example, "Agent1" for a running agent.

Beyond the agent, the context can also contain information about the `swarmName` (like "SwarmA" for a navigation event), the `storageName` (e.g., "Storage1"), the `stateName` (like "StateX"), and the `policyName` (such as "PolicyY"). 

These additional fields are intended for broader system-level use cases, such as swarm-wide events or policy enforcement, though they are not typically utilized within ClientAgent’s agent-centric event emissions. The context is a flexible mechanism for associating events with specific resources within the swarm.

## Interface IBusEvent

The IBusEvent interface defines a structured event format used for communication within the swarm system’s internal bus. It’s designed to be extensively utilized by ClientAgent’s `bus.emit` calls, specifically for events like “run” and “commit-user-message.”

Each IBusEvent carries detailed information about an action or state change, allowing agents to broadcast events to the bus.

Key properties include:

*   **source:**  This identifies the component that originated the event.  It’s consistently “agent-bus” for ClientAgent events (like those from `RUN_FN` or `_emitOutput`), but can hold other values for events originating from different buses.
*   **type:** A unique string identifier representing the event’s purpose, such as “run” or “commit-user-message.”
*   **input:** A key-value object containing event-specific data, often linked to the content of an IModelMessage.
*   **output:** A key-value object holding event-specific results, which may be empty for notification-only events.
*   **context:**  Optional metadata providing additional context, typically including the agent’s name, used primarily by ClientAgent.

## Interface IBus

The IBus interface is the core mechanism for communication within the swarm system. It provides a way for agents, primarily ClientAgents, to send updates and information to other components asynchronously. Think of it as a central bulletin board where agents can post messages to be seen by the system.

Here’s how it works:

*   **Asynchronous Broadcasting:** Agents use the `emit` method to send events. This means the agent doesn’t have to wait for a direct response; the event is queued or sent through a channel, and the system will handle it later.
*   **Targeted Delivery:** Each event is sent to a specific client using its session ID (clientId). This ensures that the right client receives the information.
*   **Standardized Events:** All events follow a consistent structure defined by the IBaseEvent interface. This includes fields like `type` (a unique identifier for the event), `source` (who sent the event), `input` (data associated with the event), `output` (data resulting from the event), `context` (metadata like the agent’s name), and `clientId` (the recipient’s ID).
*   **Common Use Cases:** Agents primarily use the bus to announce events like the completion of a stateless run (`"run"`), the emission of validated output (`"emit-output"`), or the commit of messages/tools (`"commit-*"`).  These events trigger actions in other parts of the system.

**Example Scenarios:**

*   **Stateless Run Completion:** A ClientAgent might emit a `"run"` event when a stateless operation is finished, sending the transformed result to the system.
*   **Output Emission:** After validating an output, an agent could broadcast it using an `"emit-output"` event.

**Key Features:**

*   **Redundancy:** The `clientId` is included in every event, providing a layer of validation or filtering.
*   **Type Safety:** The generic `<T extends IBaseEvent>` ensures that events are always structured according to the IBaseEvent standard.
*   **Integration:** The IBus works in conjunction with other system components, such as history updates (using `history.push`) and callbacks (e.g., `onOutput`), to create a comprehensive system-wide notification system.

## Interface IBaseEvent

The `IBaseEvent` interface forms the core structure for all events within the swarm system. It establishes a fundamental framework for communication between different components, including agents and sessions.

This interface defines the essential fields present in every event, and serves as the basis for more specialized event types like `IBusEvent` and `ICustomEvent`.

Key aspects of `IBaseEvent` include:

*   **source:** A string that identifies the origin of the event.  This is typically a generic string like "custom-source," but in practice, it’s often "agent-bus" for events originating from the agent bus.
*   **clientId:** A unique identifier that ensures the event is delivered to the correct client or session. This `clientId` matches the one used in runtime parameters, such as `this.params.clientId`.

## Interface IAgentToolCallbacks

The `IAgentToolCallbacks` interface defines a set of callbacks to manage the lifecycle of individual tools within an agent swarm. It provides hooks that can be used to control how tools are executed and handled.

Specifically, you can use the `onBeforeCall` callback to perform actions *before* a tool runs, such as logging details or preparing the necessary data.  The `onAfterCall` callback is invoked *after* the tool has completed, allowing you to handle cleanup, record results, or perform any post-execution processing.

Furthermore, the `onValidate` callback gives you the ability to check the tool's parameters *before* execution, letting you implement custom validation rules. Finally, the `onCallError` callback is triggered if a tool fails, providing a place to log errors and potentially attempt recovery. These callbacks offer granular control and flexibility for managing your agent swarm.

## Interface IAgentTool

The IAgentTool interface is the core component for managing tools used by individual agents within the swarm. It builds upon the base ITool interface to provide a structured way to define and execute specific tasks.

Each IAgentTool has a descriptive `docNote` that clarifies its purpose and how it should be utilized.  A unique `toolName` is assigned to each tool, ensuring proper identification across the entire swarm.

The `callbacks` property allows developers to customize the tool's execution flow with lifecycle events.  The primary method, `call`, takes a data transfer object containing the tool's ID, the agent's ID, the agent's name, and the parameters needed for execution.  This method then executes the tool.

Before execution, the `validate` method is called to ensure the tool parameters are valid. This validation can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the complexity of the checks.


## Interface IAgentSchemaCallbacks

The `IAgentSchemaCallbacks` interface provides a set of callbacks to manage different stages of an AI agent’s lifecycle. These callbacks allow you to react to key events, such as when the agent is initialized, runs without historical context, or when a tool produces output.

Specifically, you can use these callbacks to respond to:

*   `onInit`:  Receive notification when the agent is successfully initialized.
*   `onRun`:  Handle stateless agent execution, without relying on previous history.
*   `onExecute`:  React to the beginning of an agent’s execution.
*   `onToolOutput`:  Process output generated by a tool during the agent’s workflow.
*   `onSystemMessage`:  Handle messages generated by the system itself.
*   `onAssistantMessage`:  Manage the commitment of messages from the AI assistant.
*   `onUserMessage`:  Receive and process messages sent by a user.
*   `onFlush`:  Respond to the flushing of the agent’s history.
*   `onOutput`:  Handle general output produced by the agent.
*   `onResurrect`:  Manage the agent’s recovery after a pause or failure.
*   `onAfterToolCalls`:  Process events after all tool calls within a sequence have completed.
*   `onDispose`:  Handle the cleanup process when the agent is being disposed of.

These callbacks offer granular control over the agent’s behavior and interaction flow.

## Interface IAgentSchema

The `IAgentSchema` interface defines the configuration for each agent within the swarm. It outlines the agent’s core settings, including its unique name, the primary prompt it uses to guide its actions, and the specific completion mechanism employed.

Agents can be configured with a maximum number of tool calls they’re allowed to make during a cycle, and they can utilize a defined set of tools and storage options.  Furthermore, agents can depend on other agents for coordinated transitions, and their output can be validated or transformed using optional functions.

The `IAgentSchema` also provides a mechanism for customizing agent behavior through lifecycle callbacks, offering fine-grained control over the agent’s execution flow.  It supports mapping assistant messages to tool calls, particularly useful when integrating with different model types.


## Interface IAgentParams

The `IAgentParams` interface defines the settings needed to run an individual agent within the swarm. It brings together crucial information like the agent’s unique identifier (`clientId`), a logging system (`logger`) for tracking activity, and a communication channel (`bus`) for interacting with other agents.  It also includes a history tracker (`history`) to record interactions and a component (`completion`) for generating responses.  Agents can optionally utilize a set of tools (`tools`) for performing specific tasks, and a validation function (`validate`) is provided to ensure the agent’s output meets certain criteria before it’s finalized.

## Interface IAgentConnectionService

The `IAgentConnectionService` interface serves as a type definition, specifically designed to represent an `AgentConnectionService`. Its primary purpose is to clearly outline the structure of an `AgentConnectionService` while excluding any internal implementation details. This ensures that the `AgentPublicService` consistently uses only the publicly accessible operations, promoting a clean and well-defined API.


## Interface IAgent

The `IAgent` interface defines the core runtime behavior for an agent within the orchestration framework. It provides methods for the agent to operate independently, processing input without altering the conversation history – this is achieved through the `run` method. 

More complex interactions and updates to the agent’s state are handled via the `execute` method, which allows for potentially modifying the conversation history based on a specified execution mode. 

After execution, the `waitForOutput` method retrieves the agent’s final response. 

To integrate the agent’s output into the ongoing conversation, the `commitToolOutput`, `commitSystemMessage`, `commitUserMessage`, and `commitAssistantMessage` methods are used to record messages within the agent’s history. 

Finally, the `commitFlush` and `commitStopTools` methods offer control over the agent’s state, allowing for a complete reset or the immediate termination of tool execution.
