# Agent Swarm Kit

## Overview

The agent-swarm-kit is a TypeScript framework designed for creating and managing swarms of intelligent agents that can collaborate, communicate, and coordinate with each other. At its core are services for managing various components: agents (via AgentConnectionService), swarms (via SwarmConnectionService), sessions (via SessionConnectionService), history tracking (via HistoryConnectionService), and storage (via StorageConnectionService).

The system follows a validation-schema pattern where each component (tools, agents, swarms, storage, embeddings, and completions) has both a validation service for runtime checks and a schema service for type definitions. Client implementations (ClientAgent, ClientSwarm, ClientSession, ClientHistory, and ClientStorage) provide concrete implementations of these services' interfaces.

The framework designed with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to create complex agent interactions while maintaining control through validation, schema enforcement, and proper connection management. Public services act as fa√ßades, providing simplified interfaces for external consumers, while connection services handle the internal complexity of maintaining state, coordinating components, and enforcing business rules.

## ToolValidationService

The `ToolValidationService` is a service designed for validating tools within an agent-swarm system. It provides a way to add new tools and validate their existence. The service utilizes a loggerService for logging purposes and maintains an internal map of tools, represented by `_toolMap`.

To add a new tool to the validation service, you can use the `addTool` function. This function takes two parameters: `toolName`, which is the name of the tool, and `toolSchema`, which is an object representing the schema of the tool.

To validate if a specific tool exists in the validation service, you can use the `validate` function. This function takes two parameters: `toolName`, which is the name of the tool to be validated, and `source`, which represents the source of the tool.

By using these functions, you can effectively manage and validate tools within your agent-swarm system.

## ToolSchemaService

The `ToolSchemaService` is a service that manages tool schemas. It has a constructor that initializes the service with a logger and registry. The `register` function allows you to register a tool with a given key and value, while the `get` function retrieves a tool by its key. This service is used for managing and accessing tool schemas in the application.

## SwarmValidationService

The SwarmValidationService is a service used for validating swarms and their agents. It has a constructor, loggerService and agentValidationService properties. The constructor is used to initialize the service, while loggerService and agentValidationService are used for logging and validating agents respectively. The service also has a swarmMap property for storing swarms and their associated agents.

To add a new swarm, you can use the `addSwarm` method by providing a swarm name and its schema. This will add the swarm to the swarm map.

To retrieve a list of agents for a given swarm, you can use the `getAgentList` method by providing a swarm name. This will return an array of agent names associated with the swarm.

To validate a swarm and its agents, you can use the `validate` method by providing a swarm name and the source code of the swarm. This will validate the swarm and its agents using the loggerService and agentValidationService properties.

## SwarmSchemaService

The service also has a loggerService for logging events, an embeddingValidationService for validating embedded storages, and a storageMap for managing the stored data.

To use this service, you can create an instance of StorageValidationService and pass any necessary dependencies to the constructor. You can then add new storages using the `addStorage` method, which takes a storage name and its schema. To validate an existing storage, use the `validate` method by providing its name and source.

This service helps ensure that the storages within the storage swarm are properly validated and managed, providing a reliable foundation for your application.

## StorageUtils

The `StorageUtils` class implements the `TStorage` interface and provides various methods for interacting with a storage system. It allows you to take, upsert, remove, get, list, and clear items from the storage.

- `constructor()`: Initializes an instance of the `StorageUtils` class.
