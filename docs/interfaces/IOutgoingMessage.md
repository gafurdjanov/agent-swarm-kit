# IOutgoingMessage

Interface representing an outgoing message sent from the swarm system.
Encapsulates a message dispatched to a client, typically an agent’s response or output (e.g., ClientAgent._emitOutput), delivered via sessions (e.g., ISession.emit) or events (e.g., IBus.emit "emit-output").
Used to communicate results or notifications back to the client, reflecting the system’s response to incoming messages or internal actions.

## Properties

### clientId

```ts
clientId: string
```

The unique identifier of the client receiving the message.
Specifies the target client session, matching clientId in runtime params (e.g., this.params.clientId in ClientAgent), ensuring delivery to the intended recipient.
Example: "client-123" for a user session receiving a response.

### data

```ts
data: string
```

The content or payload of the outgoing message.
Contains the data sent to the client, typically a string (e.g., processed result, assistant response), generated by agents (e.g., result in ClientAgent._emitOutput).
Example: "The weather is sunny." for an agent’s response to a query.

### agentName

```ts
agentName: string
```

The name of the agent sending the message.
Identifies the originating agent instance (e.g., this.params.agentName in ClientAgent), aligning with AgentName from IAgentParams to indicate the source of the response.
Example: "WeatherAgent" for an agent replying to a client query.
