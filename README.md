# 🐝 agent-swarm-kit

> A TypeScript library for building sophisticated multi-agent AI systems

## Installation

```bash
npm install agent-swarm-kit
```

## Briefing

Agent Swarm Kit lets you build intelligent multi-agent systems where different agents can collaborate, execute tasks, and communicate seamlessly. Think of it like creating a team of specialized AI agents that can work together, share information, validate their actions, and track their interactions - all through a structured TypeScript framework. It's essentially a toolkit for creating complex, coordinated AI workflows where agents can execute commands, commit outputs, and maintain a history of their interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Create and manage complex agent networks
- Enable agents to execute tasks, communicate, and collaborate
- Provide robust validation for tools, agents, and sessions
- Track agent interactions and maintain comprehensive history
- Support seamless message passing and output tracking

**Core Components:**
- Agent Management: Create, validate, and connect agents
- Session Handling: Execute commands across agent networks
- Tool Validation: Ensure agent tools meet system requirements
- History Tracking: Log and retrieve agent interactions

**Use Cases:**
- AI-powered workflow automation
- Collaborative problem-solving systems
- Complex task distribution across specialized agents
- Intelligent system design with modular agent architecture
